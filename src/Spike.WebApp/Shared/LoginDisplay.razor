@* The AuthorizeView component selectively displays UI content depending on 
whether the user is authorized. This approach is useful when you only need to 
display data for the user and don't need to use the user's identity in 
procedural logic. *@
<AuthorizeView>
    Hello, @context.User.Identity?.Name!
